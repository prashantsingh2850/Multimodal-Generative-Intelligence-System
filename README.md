## Title  
**Deep Learning–Based Multimodal Context Understanding and Generative Intelligence System Using LSTM and Transformer Architectures**

## Overview  
This project aims to design and develop a deep learning–based multimodal intelligence system capable of understanding and generating contextual information from both textual and visual data. By combining recurrent neural networks and attention-based transformer architectures, the system achieves enhanced semantic understanding across multiple data modalities.

## Problem Statement  
The project focuses on developing a multimodal system using LSTM and transformer architectures to analyze text and image data. Exploratory data analysis is performed to identify hidden patterns and cross-modal relationships. The system supports contextual understanding and generative intelligence and is deployed on free cloud-based platforms.

## Objectives  
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on textual and visual datasets  
- To learn sequential and contextual representations using LSTM networks  
- To apply transformer-based attention mechanisms for contextual understanding  
- To build a multimodal representation learning framework  
- To deploy the system as an interactive web application  

## Methodology  
The system processes textual and visual inputs through separate deep learning pipelines. Text data is modeled using LSTM networks to capture sequential dependencies, while attention-based transformer mechanisms enhance contextual understanding. Visual data is analyzed using deep neural networks. Cross-modal embeddings are learned to align semantic information across modalities, followed by generative modeling for contextual output generation.

## Dataset  
Publicly available benchmark datasets are used for both textual and visual modalities. These datasets enable effective exploratory data analysis and representation learning across diverse data distributions.
