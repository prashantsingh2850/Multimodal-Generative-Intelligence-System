## 📌 Title  
**Deep Learning–Based Multimodal Context Understanding and Generative Intelligence System Using LSTM and Transformer Architectures**




## ❓ Problem Statement  
The project develops a multimodal system using LSTM and transformer architectures to analyze text and image data. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify hidden patterns and cross-modal relationships. The system enables contextual understanding and generative intelligence and is deployed on free cloud-based platforms.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on textual and visual datasets  
- Learn sequential representations using LSTM networks  
- Apply transformer-based attention mechanisms for contextual modeling  
- Build a multimodal feature fusion framework  
- Deploy an interactive web-based application  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
Textual data is modeled using LSTM networks to capture temporal dependencies, while transformer-based attention mechanisms enhance contextual understanding. Visual data is processed using deep neural networks. Cross-modal embeddings are learned to align semantic information, followed by generative modeling.

## 📂 Dataset  
Publicly available benchmark datasets are used for both textual and visual modalities, enabling effective exploratory data analysis and representation learning across diverse data distributions.
